## Why DCI?

DCI (Data Context Interaction) is a new way to look at object-oriented programming. Instead of focusing on individual objects, the DCI paradigm focuses on communication between object and makes it explicit. It improves the readability of the code, which helps programmers to reason about their programs.

I've been reading blogs posts and watching talks about DCI for two years and now I feel that it's time to try it out. I found that most material related to DCI is theoretical. There are a few books, a dozen of blog posts, and several presentations that can give you a good picture of what DCI is. However, I could not find any real world (or close) examples of actually using it.

## Like what?

Like the following projects:

* [DDDSample](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/). This is a how-to example of implementing a typical DDD application.

* [The Silverlight Cookbook](http://silverlightcookbook.codeplex.com/). A reference application for Silverlight 5 LOB apps.

The same way I feel about DCI right now I felt after reading the Domain Driven Design book. I knew there was a lot of value in the DDD approach, but I was missing a real world example illustrating all the building blocks working together.  Discovering DDDSample helped a lot. Looking at the source code of a real application is what I needed for an “Aha!” moment.
 
## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop an application using the DCI paradigm. The application won't be a real "real life” application, just a few thousands of lines of code. Nonetheless, it should be enough to illustrate the basic principles behind DCI.

## Ruby/Rails

The application will be a Rails project. There are a few reasons for it:

* All the DCI concepts can be implemented in Ruby. It doesn’t feel clunky or alien.
* Ruby is concise and readable. Even if you are a C# programmer, you should be able to understand what is going on.

* There is more interest in DCI in the Ruby community than in any other community. 

## This is not a book

Just to make it clear; the goal is not to write a book about DCI, but to develop an application. If you want to read about DCI check out the following links:

* [Lean Architecture](http://www.leansoftwarearchitecture.com/)

* [Clean Ruby](http://clean-ruby.com/)

## Plan

* I am going to start by publishing some links that should help everyone interested in the topic to get up to speed.

* Then I'm planning to come up with the requirements for the application. I'll create a git repository and a wiki.

* And finally I’ll start writing some code. 
 
## How to contribute

If you are interested in DCI and you'd like to join in, there are a few ways you can do it:

* If you have any ideas or comments, feel free to use the wiki or send an email to [vic.savkin@gmail.com](mailto:vic.savkin@gmail.com).

* Feel like writing code? Just clone for the github repository that will be created and send a pull request. If you want a closer collaboration, send an email to [vic.savkin@gmail.com](mailto:vic.savkin@gmail.com) and we'll figure something out.

Since I'm by no means an expert in DCI and this project is my attempt to learn it, I'd appreciate all kinds of comments and questions.

## Follow to project

I'm going to blog about the project at [Victor Savkin's Blog](http://victorsavkin.com) and tweet about it at [@VictorSavkin](http://twitter.com/victorsavkin).
